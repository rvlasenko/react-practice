# React practice

Personal React practice repository, primarily for learning and revision.

This repository contains small to medium-sized exercises focused on accessibility (a11y), state management, effects, UI behavior, etc.

Each exercise lives in its own `apps` folder and may use a headless UI approach, with the focus on logic rather than styling.

## How to start

`npm --workspace apps/countdown-timer run dev`
